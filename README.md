## Jikan
> Jikan - Time in Japanese

### What do we need

- [ ] start time pick
- [ ] end time pick
- [ ] each note created, keep timestamp
- [ ] end merge all to one with timestamp on left
- [ ] use the start and end time + duration between notes to start from 00:00 => end


Plan
- [ ] vite app
- [ ] use vue
- [ ] chat like interface with a big ass box below
- [ ] each time type and send to top with timestamp
- [ ] last take all notes
- [ ] ask for start and end time
- [ ] create timestamps starting 0 with intervals as stops
