### What do we need

- [ ] ~start time pick~ automatic
- [ ] ~end time pick~ automatic
- [X] each note created, keep timestamp
- [X] end merge all to one with timestamp on left
- [X] ~use the start and end time + duration between notes to~ start from 00:00 => end

### Plan
- [X] vite app
- [X] use vue
- [X] chat like interface with a big ass box below
- [X] each time type and send to top with timestamp
- [X] last take all notes
- [ ] ~ask for start and end time~
- [X] create timestamps starting 0 with intervals as stops
